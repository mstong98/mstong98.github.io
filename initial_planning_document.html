                           Knowing about the weather forecast is essential to our everyday lives. Nobody wants to see a bunch of unwanted ads blocking essential weather information on screen. Weather is our guide to safety.

                           Because Weather is so essential, we need to be able to access it at anytime, anywhere whether you are at home or on the go. This wesbite is targeted towards the audience of ages 15-35 and focused on the U.S, not other countries. Not everyone has a computer, but many have cell phones, so this website will be built towards mobile users. There will of course be a desktop version for computers, but it will not look as clean as the mobile version. The level of education will be from high schoolers to younger middle-aged people. The basic essentials that users will look for when accessing this website will be features such as temperature, wind, direction, current weather, feel like temperature, city, state. Those accessing this website will be impressed by the wonderful contrast and alignment of text.
