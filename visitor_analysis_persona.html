                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>
                    What are their demographics? Age, Income, Education, Geographic Location.
                    So Accuweather is a free weather website to be informed about Weather in the U.S and sometimes out of the U.S.
                    The age group for someone that visits this website is generally anyone that checks the weather.
                    Income doesn't really apply because anyone can access this website.
                    Education, again doesn't require much except for a knowledge of how to access the internet.
                    Geographic Location: Anywhere that has WiFi.

                </p>
                <p>
                    How did the site meet the needs of the visitor (be specific in terms of "Less is More)?
                    It shows accurate(most of the time) weather information and any advisories that describe what type of weather will be affected those areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Describe how the content was organized to facilitate it being found.
                    There were neat tabs to locate information and great Contrast to differentiate between links.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What did the site to make the mobile experience enjoyable (or at least not painful)?
                    Well to start off, the website goes straight to the mobile version if you are on a device and desktop mode for laptops so that is nice because some websites don't have mobile verions, only desktop versions which makes certain websites, like Brightspace.com very hard to see and navigate.
                </p>p>
                <p>
                    Did the site seem to facilitate people in a mobile environment (Think about the descriptions in the Visitor Considerations reading)? If "Yes", how?
                    Yes, because everything was large text and easy to read/navigate without hesitation.

                    What was the worst site you came across during the 24 hour mobile browsing experience?
                    A: Brightspace was the worst during the 24 hour period. URL: https://brightspace.com
                </p>
                <p>
                    How did your best site differ from the worst in knowing who their target audience was?

                    A: Because AccuWeather is such a huge weather platform, they know many people will access their site from the web on a mobile device and therefore they made it so everyone can access it easily. If it were brightspace, only college students at BYU-Idaho use it and  young adults are easily able to access Brightspace even on desktop mode since that's what you get on a mobile device if you go to the website.

                <p>
                    How did your best site differ from the worst in meeting the needs of their audience?

                    A: AccuWeather made it very easy to meet the needs of everyone who was accessing their website by making an easy to use UI. Brightspace made it hard with only desktop mode being available.

                </p>
                <p>
                    How did your best site differ from the worst in organizing content to facilitate it being found?

                    A: AccuWeather has great color Contrast and easy to use navigation links. Brightspace makes everything small to see and hard to navigate with small link buttons.

                    How did your best site differ from the worst in facilitating visitors in a mobile environment?

                    A: AccuWeather makes it easy to navigate with only things you need to see based on the area you are located in and not weather or news for places that you don't live in.

                    Brightspace is in desktop mode and everything is hard to see unless you zoom in a lot.
